# PasswordEvolver
Python program that evolves strings randomly until one is the correct password.

# About
After watching a few videos on evolution simulators, I decided to implement one myself, using strings.
The first set of strings are randomly generated and evaluated against the correct key. Strings that are close move on,
while those that are far away are replaced with new strings which are mutations of the best strings. Eventually, the key is
succesfully mutated.
